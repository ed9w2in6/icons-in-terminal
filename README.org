  ed9w2in6 at [2023-10-31 Tue]:
  Please read [[file:HOW_TO_SETUP_2023.org]] for a updated setup instruction.
  Especially some special steps for macOS and Emacs users.
  
  ed9w2in6 at [2023-10-31 Tue]:
  This project still works but I have stopped using it.
  I forked this to update a few instructions and test scripts to avoid confusion of any new users on setup.
  The [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal][original repo]] is not very active and confuses some user during setup.  
  Please report issue [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal][upstream]], but not here, thanks.

  If you use Emacs, I recommend using https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons.el instead.
  If you must use this project, I recommend this one:
  + https://github.com/seagle0128/icons-in-terminal.el

  Please do read the installation instruction, I saw a lot of issue upstream that due to improper setup.
  I have written a simple setup guide here.
* Overview
  - =icons-in-terminal= allows you to get any fonts in your terminal
    without replacing or patching your font.\\
  - You can add as many fonts as you want easily, you just need the
    ttf/odf file and add it to =config.json=.\\
  - =icons-in-terminal= can also be use with graphical applications.

* Installation
    #+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal.git
    #+end_src

To install =icons-in-terminal=, run:

  #+begin_src sh
./install.sh  
# Follow the instructions to edit ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/30-icons.conf
  #+end_src

Or if your terminal is
[[https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal/issues/1][supported]]
(Experimental)

  #+begin_src sh
./install-autodetect.sh 
  #+end_src

Done ! You can start a new terminal and run =print_icons.sh= to see the
installed gryphs.

  
You can see names of each icon by giving any parameter to
=print_icons.sh=:

ed9w2in6 [2023-10-31 Tue]: the bash script relies on a unicode escaping feature
that is only available to bash version >= 4.2.  Check yours with =bash --version=.
ref: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2011-02/msg00012.html#:%7E:text=UXXXXXXXX%20escape%20sequences

  #+begin_src sh
# /print_icons.py or ./print_icons.zsh may work better.
./print_icons.sh
./print_icons.sh --names
./print_icons.sh --names | grep ANY_NAME
  #+end_src

ed9w2in6 [2023-10-31 Tue]: Alternatively, use the *python* (=./print_icons.py=) or *zsh* (=./print_icons.zsh=) script to check your setup.
  + The =python= script is written by, [[https://github.com/amoriello][amoriello]], see the original [[https://github.com/sebastiencs/icons-in-terminal/issues/1#issuecomment-320480809][here]].

    To use icons in your terminal, *do not copy-paste icons* from the output
    of =print_icons.sh= but use their variable name: see
    [[#integrations][integrations]].\\
    When one of the provided font will be updated and add new icons, some
    codepoints in =icons-in-terminal.ttf= will be changed, the variable
    names won't.

* Building
  If you want to add new font, follow these instructions:

  There are a few dependencies to install:

  - Python 3
  - [[https://fontforge.github.io][fontforge (with python extension)]]

  You can add the name and path of your font to the file =config.json=.\\
  Each font can take parameters:\\
  - =start-from=: exclude all glyphes before the given codepoint. -
  =until=: exclude all glyphes at the given codepoint and after. -
  =excludes=: exclude the given codepoints. - =move-vertically=: Use this
  parameter if your font and its glyphes are not centered vertically. -
  =short-name=: Prefix to insert before the glyph name when you want to
  use the icon in your shell or anywhere else - =map-names=: Define a name
  to the glyph. If not provided, the name will be read from the ttf file

  Once done, you can run:

#+begin_src sh
./build.sh
  #+end_src

* How it works
  This project is inspired by
  [[https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts][awesome-terminal-fonts]]
  but is different.\\
  I don't modify any existing font, I merge all glyphes from the provided
  fonts in a new font file and insert them in the
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas][private use
  areas]].\\
  The file =~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/30-icons.conf= tells to freetype
  to search the glyph in =icons-in-terminal.ttf= if it fails in your
  default font file. As the codepoints generated are in the private use
  areas, freetype should always fail and fallback to
  icons-in-terminal.ttf\\
  The only requirement is that your default font shouldn't be already
  patched/modified. But why use a patched font with a limited number of
  glyphes when they are all included here :)\\
  Your terminal emulator should also support
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallback_font][fallback font]] (most of
  them support it)

* Included icons
  There are already 3618 glyphes included:

* Integrations
** Fish integration
   To use =icons-in-terminal= with fish, add this line to
   =~/.config/fish/config.fish=:

 #+begin_src sh
source ~/.local/share/icons-in-terminal/icons.fish
   #+end_src

   Restart a terminal, now you can print any icons with its name:

 #+begin_src sh
echo $oct_location
   #+end_src

** Bash integration
   ed9w2in6: requries bash version >= 4.2, ref: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2011-02/msg00012.html#:%7E:text=UXXXXXXXX%20escape%20sequences
   Add this line to your .bashrc:

 #+begin_src sh
source ~/.local/share/icons-in-terminal/icons_bash.sh
   #+end_src

   Restart a terminal, now you can print any icons with its name:

 #+begin_src sh
echo -e $oct_location # note the '-e'
      #+end_src

** Emacs integration
   ed9w2in6:
   Please refer to file:HOW_TO_SETUP_2023.org for latest working setup instructions for Emacs.
   If you had to use =icons-in-terminal= then I recommend https://github.com/seagle0128/icons-in-terminal.el instead for proper integration.

   Content from original repo below (outdated):
   
   Add this line to your emacs init file:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output scalar :eval no
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.local/share/icons-in-terminal/")
  #+end_src

   To use icons-in-terminal in your package:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results output scalar :eval no
  (require 'icons-in-terminal)
  (insert (icons-in-terminal 'oct_flame)) ; C-h f icons-in-terminal[RET] for more info
  #+end_src
